The save contains the world and spawn position, which is stored in Config.txt


Each .chunk file contains a chunk of the map, which is 16x16 cells.
The filename name is "XxY.chunk", where X and Y are the decimal offset values.

Each cell uses 3 bytes.
To find the offset in the file to a spesific cell, use this: (X+Y*16)*3
The 3 bytes contain these values:

4bit - Ground color(5 = none)
4bit - RESERVED    (probably attributes for the object, or BGM changer)
8bit - Object ID   (0 = none)
8bit - Tile ID     (0 = none)
