# Navi Network

A small game I made back in think 2011.
An online game inspired by the self-hosted nature of Minecraft, made with pygame, based on the MegaMan Battle Network series.
The `MainServer` is a central server only used to list the other `Server`s.
It never really moved beyond a proof of concept. 

Please **do not** [register](http://navinet.pbsds.net:81/) an account with a password you use elsewhere, as MD5 really is not a safe means of hashing!
If needed, a user with name **foo** and password **bar** should exist.
